# Treasure-Hunter-Project
Author: Levi Johnson
Description: A third-person game made in Unreal Engine in which
  the player searches for and collects buried treasure items on
  a beach, made with multiple tiles that can be dug through with
  a player shovel tool. This project utilized Unreal Engine 4, 
  Visual Studio, C++, and Unreal Blueprints to practice skills 
  in Game Physics, Game Engine mastery, and solving complex 
  logic problems.
